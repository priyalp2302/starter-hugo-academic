My name is Priyal Padheriya and I am currently pursuing my Masters of Science in Computer Science at Arizona State University (ASU). I completed my Bachelor of Technology from Nirma Univeristy with Information Technlogy as a major and Finance as a minor.

Currently, I am working part-time as a Graduate Researcher at {{< staticref "https://theluminositylab.com" "newtab" >}}The Luminosity Lab{{< /staticref >}}. Before coming to ASU, I worked as a Software Developer at {{< staticref "https://www.playpowerlabs.com" "newtab" >}}PlayPower Labs{{< /staticref >}} where I worked on developing an Invenotory Management System using MEAN stack. Apart from this, I have also interned as a Project Manager at {{< staticref "https://www.ajmerainfotech.com" "newtab" >}}Ajmera Infotech Pvt. Ltd.{{< /staticref >}} where I got a chance to learn about how a project is planned from the very beginning. Redpen.ai and JoinUs.ai are the two projects I wrecked on during my internship. Apart from this, I have always been curious to learn more about web development and I also freelanced as Web Developer to help create websites for local startups.

Talking about the non-technical skills, I love to cook new recipes, explore different places, and dance. I enjoy meeting new people and learn about their culture. Currently, I am looking for full time opportunities in the field of Computer Science, please reach out if you feel I am a good fit for your organization or know someone offering similar opportunities.
